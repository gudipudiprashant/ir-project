Problem Statement:
-----------------
Extract relevant entities from an article, which is from a specific domain.
The domain chosen is terrrorist attacks.

Definitions:
------------
1.  Entity: A Person, Location, Organization, Time, Collection or domain specific terms.
2.  Relevant: Dates(event date or article date), or entities that are directly affected by or contribute to the event are relevant.

Motivation:
-----------
Some use-cases for the solution of this problem are:
1.  Article Summarization
2.  Grouping related articles.
3.  Describing the event
4.  Information retrieval of relevant articles using entity as a query.

Solution Approach:
------------------
Entities that answer the questions: Who, What, When, Where about the event are relevant entities.
These questions may need to be framed using domain-specific terms, such as "who is the accused?" in the case of terror attacks.

Evaluation:
-----------
The "ground-truth" entities must describe the event, not necessarily help in recognition. They must also satisfy the above "relevant" and "entity" definitions.
